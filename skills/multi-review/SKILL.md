description: >-
  Review one change with every available reviewer at once — the Codex CLI, the
  built-in code-review workflow, the built-in security review — then consolidate
  their findings and report what each one actually covered. Use when the user
  asks for a review of the current change ("прогони ревью", "review this",
  "second opinion on this diff"), and before finished work is handed off to a
  pull or merge request when no shipping flow is already driving that handoff —
  a ship in progress owns the order of steps and calls this itself. Report-only:
  it never applies fixes; the caller decides what to do with them. Not an
  auto-trigger on every edit.

# Multi-review

Runs several independent reviewers over one change and returns a single write-up:
the consolidated findings, plus a line per reviewer stating what it covered. The
reviewers disagree about what "the change" even is, and that disagreement is where
coverage silently disappears — most of this skill exists to keep it visible.

Report-only. Never fix what comes back; hand findings and coverage to the caller.

## 1. Scope

**Kind.** Default is the change itself. Two variations are available on request:
narrowed (a path, or a focus such as "only error handling") and working-tree-only
("just what I changed since the last commit"). A request to audit existing code —
"look through the whole directory", "check every component" — is *not* a change:
each reviewer builds a diff and reviews nothing when that diff is empty. Say so
and stop, rather than quietly reviewing the last commit instead.

**Base.** First hit wins:

1. a base the caller named;
2. the open PR's base — `gh pr view --json baseRefName -q .baseRefName`;
3. where this repo's PRs actually land —
   `gh pr list --state merged --limit 10 --json baseRefName -q '.[].baseRefName' | sort | uniq -c`;
4. the default branch — `git symbolic-ref --short refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`;
5. `@{upstream}`, last resort — it narrows the review to unpushed commits.

**Range.** Base → working tree, so one pass covers the branch's commits together
with the uncommitted edits sitting on top of them.

**Risk** decides effort in the next step. The default is `high` on every ladder —
name the level, never "the middle", which lands on a different rung per reviewer.
Raise it when the change reaches past itself (public interface, shared helper,
config, schema, wire format), cannot be walked back (it writes, migrates,
publishes, or persists a format someone else reads), meets input whose shape you
do not control, has nothing else checking it (no tests that run, no types, no
compiler), removes a guard, an error path or a test, or touches paths the project
marks sensitive (`CLAUDE.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `SECURITY.md`). Lower it only for
mechanics with no behavior change; an explicit instruction from the caller wins.

**Uncommitted work.** When `git status --short` or
`git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` shows anything belonging to the change,
offer a commit before starting, and name the price of declining: Codex and
code-review read the working tree and see the edits either way, the security
review reads a commit range and does not, and files that are not tracked at all
are invisible to every reviewer. Offer — never commit anything yourself. A refusal
is a fine answer; it just goes into the report.

## 2. Pick

Three questions per reviewer, in order:

- **Available?** If not, record `UNAVAILABLE` with the reason; do not launch it.
- **Applicable?** When the scope asks for something a reviewer cannot do, skip it
  with a recorded reason — `n/a`.
- **How hard?** Map the risk onto that reviewer's own ladder and pass the level
  explicitly — never a machine-local default, since this skill runs on other
  people's machines.

| Reviewer | Available when | Reads | Narrowing | Ladder |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `codex-review` skill | `command -v codex` | base → working tree | yes, expressed in prose | `minimal` `low` `medium` `high` `xhigh` |
| `code-review` workflow | the `Workflow` tool exists | `@{upstream}...HEAD` plus `git diff HEAD` unless given a target | yes, as a target argument | `high` `xhigh` `max` |
| `security-review` skill | the skill is in your skill list | commits only; base pinned to the default branch | no | none |

What that decides in practice: the security review goes `n/a` on a narrowed or
working-tree-only scope, and is mis-scoped whenever the PR targets anything but
the default branch — report that, do not hide it. The code-review workflow is the
only reviewer checking `CLAUDE.md` compliance, and its cheap levels are out of
reach: `low` and `medium` belong to the `/code-review` slash command, which only
the user can invoke, and an unknown level is not rejected — it silently becomes
`high`, with the word forwarded as the review target.

## 3. Run

Start the detachable reviewers first so they overlap with the inline one.

- **codex-review** — invoke the skill, passing the base, the effort level, and the
  fact that this is a pipeline run so it backgrounds the call.
- **code-review** — `Workflow({ name: "code-review", args: "<level> <base>" })`
  returns immediately and runs detached. Hand it the resolved base: left to
  itself it diffs `@{upstream}...HEAD`, which on an already-pushed branch is
  empty, and it would review nothing while the other two review the change. This
  skill is the explicit instruction authorizing that call.
- **security-review** — invoke the skill inline, last. Do not delegate it to a
  subagent to save context: subagents have neither the `Agent` nor the `Task`
  tool, so the skill's own filtering pass — parallel sub-tasks dropping every
  candidate below confidence 8 — silently does not run, and what comes back is
  unfiltered.

## 4. Collect

Take two things from each reviewer: what it covered — base and file count, from
that reviewer's own output — and its findings. Never carry one reviewer's count
across to another's row; a borrowed number is how a reviewer that read nothing
gets recorded as having read the change.

**Zero files covered is not a pass.** Decide it by the count, never by matching a
reviewer's wording: each phrases an empty review differently, and Codex phrases it
differently again between `--base` and `--uncommitted`.

**Less than the change is not a pass either.** A reviewer that ran against the
wrong base, or over only the committed half while the rest sat in the working
tree, covered a nonzero number of the wrong files. That is `partial`, and it
counts as a gap — say what it missed.

When a reviewer fails, quote its error instead of guessing a cause. A `401` or an
auth complaint in Codex's log means `codex login`, and one line saying so beats
twenty lines of transcript.

## 5. Consolidate

Dedup by `(file, line)` **and** by mechanism — reviewers routinely anchor one root
cause at different lines, and one bug described twice reads as two. Keep whichever
write-up carries the concrete failure scenario, and rank by severity.

## 6. Report

Coverage first, as a table — one row per reviewer, what it covered before its
verdict:

| Reviewer | Covered | Effort | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `codex-review` | `origin/master`, 3 files | high | 2 findings |
| `code-review` | `origin/master`, 3 files | high | no findings |
| `security-review` | `origin/master`, 1 of 3 files | — | partial: rest uncommitted |

Keep the cells short. "Covered" is always `<base>, N files`, effort gets its own
column so a level is never left implied, and "Result" is a verdict — never the
description of a finding, which belongs below the table where it can wrap freely.
A fixed-width block pretending to be a table wraps badly in a narrow window and
the columns drift apart.

Four statuses, kept apart deliberately: `UNAVAILABLE` — the reviewer could not
run; `n/a` — it was deliberately not run, and why; `nothing to review` — it ran
and covered zero files; `partial` — it ran but covered less than the change, or
the wrong range. Everything except `n/a` is a gap in coverage.

Then the findings, and nothing else: no fixes, no patches, no offer to apply them.

When a PR or MR is about to be opened, say the gaps out loud before the handoff
rather than burying them under the findings. Whoever is shipping decides what to
do about them, but a ship with a reviewer silently missing is exactly what the
coverage lines exist to prevent.
